    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a complete **image processing pipeline** built using OpenCV.  \n",
    "The pipeline reads an image, applies a series of filters and transformations, detects edges, and draws contours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:** A classmate wrote this pipeline the night before the lab, ran it once, and it seemed fine.  \n",
    "But when reviewed carefully, **5 bugs were found** — some cause wrong output, some cause crashes, and one is a logic error that gives plausible-but-incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read through each section of the pipeline carefully\n",
    "- Run each cell and observe the output (errors, warnings, or wrong images)\n",
    "- **Find all 5 bugs**, understand why each one is wrong, and fix it\n",
    "- Fill in the answer cells below each section\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do **not** jump to the answer key at the bottom until you've attempted each bug\n",
